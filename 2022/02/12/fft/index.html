<h2 id="一、离散傅里叶变换"><a href="#一、离散傅里叶变换" class="headerlink" title="一、离散傅里叶变换"></a>一、离散傅里叶变换</h2><p>傅里叶变换的目的就是将信号转换成无数个不同频率的正弦波叠加，然后揭示这些正弦信号的强度和频率的的关系。这意味着任何信号都可以看成无数个正弦波叠加，</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-8.png" alt="upload successful"><br>当我们对一个信号进行离散傅里叶变换，就能得到n个正弦波不同频率的分量相叠加的一个函数，这是构成频域的一个最基本的条件，要使用傅里叶变换我们必须要能用一个最基本的单元也就是一个数据去表示一个正弦波分量，而这个基本单元就是复数，由于水平有限，在这里不阐述证明方法和过程。</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-9.png" alt="upload successful"><br>要理解这个复数要从正弦波的原理说起，正弦波就是一个圆周运动在一条直线上的投影。那么就可以用虚数来表示一个不同频率、相位、幅度的正弦波。</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-10.png" alt="upload successful"> <img src="/images/pasted-11.png" alt="upload successful"><br>在离散的傅里叶变换中，一个个的虚数就构成了信号的频域，而从图中我们也可以看出我们可以得到很多重要的信息，如幅度、相位。<br><img src="/images/pasted-12.png" alt="upload successful"><br>要理解FFT，了解离散傅里叶变换的过程是很有必要的，我们以Fs的采样频率对被测信号进行N个点的采样，得到一个N点长的数据，然后对数据进行周期延拓，再对数据进行傅里叶变换，得到以复数形式表示的数据。</p>
<h2 id="二、快速傅里叶变换"><a href="#二、快速傅里叶变换" class="headerlink" title="二、快速傅里叶变换"></a>二、快速傅里叶变换</h2><p>DFT最早是用来分析热过程，并不是用于信号领域，同时它的计算量也非常大，不能满足处理信号的效率要求，而随着计算机领域的发展，一种DFT的快速算法被发现也就是FFT，FFT才被广泛使用。</p>
<p>由这种方法计算DFT对于X（K）的每个K值，需要进行4N次实数相乘和（4N-2）次相加，对于N个k值，共需N<em>N乘和N（4N-2）次实数相加。改进DFT算法，减小它的运算量，利用DFT中 的周期性和对称性，使整个DFT的计算变成一系列迭代运算，从而能够将运算量从 N^2 减少到 N</em>log2(N),其中 N 为待计算的序列的长度。当 N 非常大的时候，这种优化在时间维度上的提升是非常显著的，这就是FFT的基本思想。</p>
<h2 id="三、FFT在单片机中的应用"><a href="#三、FFT在单片机中的应用" class="headerlink" title="三、FFT在单片机中的应用"></a>三、FFT在单片机中的应用</h2><p>从傅里叶级数的公式中我们可以得到Fn就是频谱中的最小频率分辨率</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-13.png" alt="upload successful"><br>FFT的本质就是DFT，而我们要得到的结果也包括频域，因此我们同样要避免DFT中出现频谱混叠的问题，根据采样定理，只有当采样频率大于信号最高频率的两倍时，才能避免频域混叠。因此采样深度和频率精度要做到取舍，当当采样频率越高，根据公式，频率分辨率就会降低，但增加了采样深度；频率精度则相反。</p>
<p>在单片机中我们要进行FFT需要用到DSP库中的函数</p>
<pre><code>    void arm_rfft_fast_f32(arm_rfft_fast_instance_f32 *s,float *pIn,float *pOut,u8 ifftflag);
    //s是配置FFT参数的结构体
    //pIn是N点长的采样数组
    //pOut是N点长的以高16位储存实数、低16位储存虚数为格式的数组，也是傅里叶变换的结果
    //ifftflag是控制傅里叶正变换、逆变换的参数
    
</code></pre>
<p>进行FFT</p>
<pre><code>  #define FFT_SIZE 1024;
  float FFT_IN[FFT_SIZE],FFT_OUT[FFT_SIZE],Mag[FFT_SIZE];
  arm_rfft_fast_instance_f32 FFT;//声明结构体
  arm_rfft_fast_init_f32(&amp;FFT,FFT_SIZE);//初始化该结构体
  arm_rfft_fast_f32(&amp;FFT,FFT_IN, FFT_OUT, 0);//ifft_flag=0是正变换， 为1则是逆变换
  arm_cmplx_mag_f32(FFT_OUT, Mag, FFT_SIZE); //再对复数结果求模
  
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>FFT_SIZE和采样速率最好是4的n次幂，因为DSP库中的FFT是基4的，如果不是则会出现频谱泄露。</li>
<li>FFT_OUT中数据是以高16位储存实数、低16位储存虚数为格式的数组，通过DFT的定义我们可以从中得到相位、幅度信息<h2 id="四、频谱泄露问题"><a href="#四、频谱泄露问题" class="headerlink" title="四、频谱泄露问题"></a>四、频谱泄露问题</h2></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><h5 id="频谱泄露是什么"><a href="#频谱泄露是什么" class="headerlink" title="频谱泄露是什么"></a>频谱泄露是什么</h5>在FFT的使用过程中，我们经常会碰到的一个问题就是频谱泄漏，明明没有这个频率的分量，但FFT过后频谱中却出现了这个频率的分量，这同样也是DFT会出现的问题。</li>
</ol>
<p>这是因为在FFT的过程中，我们将采样信号进行了周期延拓，使用有有限长的序列来代表无限长的序列，再进行傅里叶变换，当采样得到得结果不是整周期，就会出现截断效应</p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-14.png" alt="upload successful"></p>
<p><img src="/images/pasted-15.png" alt="upload successful"><br>图2的信号与图1的信号不同，分析得到的频谱自然也不同，不同之处在于，图1是单一频率信号，只有一根谱线，而图2中，除了图1信号包含的这根谱线（不妨称为主谱线）外，出现了其它频率的谱线，通常，这些谱线要比主谱线短很多，如果把这些原信号不包含的谱线理解为是主谱线泄露出来的，那么，这种现象就被称为频谱泄露。</p>
<ul>
<li><h5 id="解决频谱泄露"><a href="#解决频谱泄露" class="headerlink" title="解决频谱泄露"></a>解决频谱泄露</h5></li>
</ul>
<p>要解决频谱泄露，最根本的办法就是整周期截断，以4的幂次方的采样频率进行采样，而对于无法达到采样频率要求的情况下，我们可以使用窗函数的办法。<br>采用合适的窗函数（常见的窗函数有汉宁窗、三角窗、海明窗和高斯窗等等）可以一定程度上抑制频谱泄露。这种办法简单来说就是使用加权的函数将截断部分进行圆滑处理，但同时也污染了原信号，会产生幅度相位等信息的改变。</p>
